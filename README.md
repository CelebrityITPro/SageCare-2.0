# SageCare 2.0 - Telemedicine Platform for Seniors

## 📖 Project Overview

SageCare 2.0 is an AI-powered telemedicine platform built to improve healthcare access and quality for the elderly population in Canada. 
The system integrates computer vision, NLP, and speech-to-text technologies to provide nutritional analysis, symptom diagnosis, and consultation transcription features. 
With an emphasis on security, inclusivity, simplicity, and caregiver integration, SageCare 2.0 enhances patient engagement and facilitates remote care delivery.

## 🚀 Features

- Food Nutritional Analysis from meal images
- NLP-based diagnosis from free-text symptom input
- Real-time speech-to-text transcription during video consultations
- Personalized dietary recommendations and caregiver alerts
- Role-based access for seniors and caregivers

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python, Flask (Backend API)
- Azure DevOps Boards (Agile Project Management)
- TensorFlow, PyTorch (ML Models)
- Yolo (Computer Vision)
- Whisper, Google Speech API (Speech-to-Text)
- BioBERT, Bioformer (NLP Diagnosis)
- HuggingFace, Gradio (Deployment)
- React Native (Mobile Frontend)
- USDA Nutrition Database API

## 📦 Setup Instructions
